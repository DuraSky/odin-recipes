first project

This is a first project assigment from Project Odin. This should demonstrate my so far leanerned git and HTML skills. While I am familliar with HTML, I am not with git. By the end of the project I should be better at this. 

By finishing this project I have indeed gotten myself quite familliar with usage of git and github, it is now much more clear to me. Also refreshed my html knowledge.
